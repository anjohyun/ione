# Layout and Display Settings

## Layout Overview

Rapha View™ allows the use of a virtual layout feature to run up to two [Image Display Windows] on a single monitor, enabling the simultaneous display of two studies. The virtual layout of the image display window can be configured using the [VL] menu on the menu bar. The I-Rapha View™ supports the following virtual layouts:

* Normal Layout: Displays images from one study on the screen; this is the default layout when the program is first launched.
* Vertical Layout: Places two studies side by side on the screen, showing the images for each study.
* Horizontal Layout: Arranges two studies vertically on the screen, displaying the images for each study.

1. Image Mode: Displays images belonging to the same series in the [Image Display Window], shown sequentially. The number of images displayed depends on the image layout. This mode is used to view multiple images from the same series simultaneously.
2. Stack Mode: Displays images from multiple series in the [Image Display Window], where images from each series are shown in a stacked format within a single [Image Display Window]. The number of series displayed depends on the image layout. This mode is used for viewing multiple series in one [Image Display Window].
The [Mode] menu operates in a toggle fashion, allowing you to switch between the currently applied image display mode and another mode by clicking the menu.
